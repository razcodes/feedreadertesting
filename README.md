#### Steps required to successfully run the application

Run the `index.html` file with your browser in order to load the website locally.

#### What did I learn?

I have learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 
These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

#### Acknowledgements
All files except `feedreader.js` were written and provided by Udacity.

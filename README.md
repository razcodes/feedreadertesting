### Feed Reader Testing 

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and it applies a test-driven development approach.
It uses the JavaScript Testing Framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). 

#### Installation/How to Run 

To run the Feed Reader project:
* Download the repository as a zip-file and open the ```index.html``` on your prefered browser
* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on each relevant test that you would like to perform. You can also run all the tests at once. 

#### Built With

* JavaScript and JQuery
* HTML and CSS
* **Dependencies**: 
    * [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.github.io) 

#### What did I learn?

I have learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 
The tests I've written test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
